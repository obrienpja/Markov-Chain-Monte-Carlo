# Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo

The goal of this code is to write a fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in C++, so that my friend can do his analysis more efficiently. I am following a tutorial written in Python, and I am rewriting it in C++ before I proceed. The tutorial is at http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/mcmc-sampling/.
